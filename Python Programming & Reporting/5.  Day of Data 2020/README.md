# UMN_day_of_data_2020

GitHub repo for Introduction to Neural Networks jam session at UMN Day of Data 2020

<b>Author</b>: Danny Moncada, University of Minnesota - Office of Human Resources - Data & Reporting Analyst

I developed this notebook/analysis as part of my final homework assignment for my Predictive Analytics course in December 2019.  The <b>original</b> analysis took about three weekend's worth of development work and many, many iterations to get right.

The assignment was as follows: build and train three different versions of a neural network to perform a regression task.  Seems pretty simple right?  Well members of the audience, we are about to find out how <b>wrong</b> that assumption is.

Notebook run time, start to finish, ~28 minutes.
