# Some demo notebooks with visualizations from our summer 2020 Capstone project - Predicting Employee Departures

## Background of problem
Employee turnover is a significant problem for organizations, as it is d ifficult to predict when employees will resign and often can introduce noticeable voids in an organizationâ€™s workforce .  As a result, it is imperative that organizations formulate proper recruitment, acquisition, and retention strategies, as well as implementing effective mechanism s for preventing and diminishing the impact of employee turnover, while understanding its underlying root cause s.

## Problem statement
The Office of Human Resource s at the University of Minnesota is looking to leverage machine learning & predictive modeling to predict (with at least a two-month lead time)  which full -time salaried faculty and professional staff employees have the highest probability of resigning.  The end goal of building a robust predictive model is to help HR leaders in each unit identify their employees who are most likely to resign in order to have intervention conversations and thereby increase the overall retention rate for their units and the University overall.
