###### Project Overview:
__Amazon Video Game Customer Review & Sentiment Analysis__

What is Amazon's mission?

*Our vision is to be earth's most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.*

If Amazon can learn what distinguishes helpful reviews from unhelpful reviews, it can encourage users to leave better reviews.  Amazon can also find the best reviews and move them towards the top to help users get better information faster prior to making a purchase.  This allows Amazon to enhance their customer-centric focus and prevent people from buying something they may not be happy with.

Here are some key questions that shaped our analysis:
* Are there specific words that are likely to indicate whether a rating is good or bad?
* Are there specific words that are likely to indicate if a review was considered helpful by other users?
* Can we build models to predict rating or helpfulness?
* Are there certain users who leave a lot of reviews? Are they consistently helpful?
* Are there products that get reviewed noticeable more than others?
* Do any of these variables change over time?
