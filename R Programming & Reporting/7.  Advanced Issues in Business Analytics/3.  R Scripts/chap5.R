# Note that plot(diff(ima22.s,2),ylab='Differenced Twice',type='o') will
# draw a wrong figure because the second argument is the lag not the times of
# differencing. That is, diff(ima22.s,2) is the series of ima22.s(t)-ima22.s(t-2).

# In case the function fails, check wheher all data are positive. If
