# Run the command ?par to learn more the xaxp argment.  
acf(ma1.1.s) # see the new tickmarks

# So how was xaxp determined? First run the command without xaxp to find out
# how many lags are on the x-axis. Suppose there are 20 lags. Then we specify
# xaxp=c(0,20,10), i.e. the two extreme tickmarks are 0 and 20, and we want
# 10 tickmarks in between. How to set the xaxp argument if we want 1 tickmark for
# each lag?

# ADF.test(rwalk,selectlags=list(mode=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)),itsd=c(1,0,0))
#
# The argument mode can be either a numerical vector, 
# or "aic","bic" and "signf".
# If it is a numerical vector, the test assumes the vector corresponds to the
# lags of the response that must be included in the test, and the Pmax 
# option is ignored.
# However, if mode is specified as "aic", the function uses the AIC to
# select lags up to and including Pmax to be included in the test.
# Specifying mode to "bic" or "signf" changes the selection criterion
# to BIC or significance criterion. Note "signf" not "signif" is the valid
# option. 


# In comparison, setting the true order to be zero for the first difference
ADF.test(rwalk,selectlags=list(Pmax=0),itsd=c(1,0,0))
