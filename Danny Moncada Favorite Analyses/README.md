# Danny Moncada Favorite Analyses

This repository will contain output (PDFs, Jupyter notebooks, Tableau workbooks, R scripts, R markdowns)  that I am the most proud or still use as a reference today.

* PlayerDemographics_PromotionalCampaigns_AssocationRules_Visualizations.ipynb is my finest work, and contains analyses in both Python and R.  It is a document that I will use for the rest of my career as a means of knowing what is capable across two languages.
