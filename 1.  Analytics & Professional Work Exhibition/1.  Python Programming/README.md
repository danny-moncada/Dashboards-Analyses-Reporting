# Python Programming Exhibition

This repository will contain output (PDFs, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts) of case studies and analytics work that I am the most proud of from my years as an MSBA 2020 student.

1.  <b>AS Roma Player Demographics & Assocation Rules Visualizations.ipynb</b>
* Analyzing AS Roma Player demographics & generating association rules for successful team building.

2.  <b>Modifying EMEA Audit for Hosted Jobs.ipynb</b>
* Transforming a 4/5 hour manual account reassignment process to a ~4 min Python process.

3.  <b>Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction Regression.ipynb</b>
* Final project for predictive analytics to peform regression & classification using Google Analytics data.

4.  <b>Healthcare Analytics & Visualizations.ipynb</b>
* Final project for Healthcare Analytics measuring the difference in healthcare costs of MN/WI vs. CT/NY.

5.  <b>Nice Riding with Python - Visualizing Riding & Weather Patterns in the Twin Cities.ipynb</b>
* One of my FAVORITE ALL TIME projects - final project for Programming with Data Science to compare bike riding and weather patterns in the Twin Cities.

6.  <b>OHR Professional Staff Classifier.ipynb</b>
* A production ready machine learning pipeline to classify and predict employee departures of professional staff at UMN.

7.  <b>OHR Data Engineering & Table Generation for Predicting Employee Departures.ipynb</b>
* A production ready data engineering pipeline to generate a flattened data set for ML algorithms.

8.  <b>Player Demographics & Promotional Campaigns - Assocation Rules & Data Visualizations.ipynb</b>
* Another favorite notebook and personal reference guide - measuring player demographics for a casino and developing association rules.

9.  <b>Predicting Employee Resignations Knowledge Transfer - Machine Learning 101.ipynb</b>
* A comprehensive guide to machine learning and how to construct a pipeline end-to-end - probably my most impressive work to date.

10.  <b>Building Neural Networks & Performing Complex Regression.ipynb</b>
* Day of Data session using a project from Predictive Modeling class - using Keras to build 1, 2, and 3 layer neural networks to perform a complex regression task.

11.  <b>Amazon Product & Review Score Sentiment Analysis.ipynb</b>
* Final project for Big Data using Amazon video game reviews to perform sentiment analysis about usefulness of reviewers.

12.  <b>Singular Value Decomposition of a Matrixipynb</b>
* A very simple notebook, but one I am very proud of because performing SVD by hand for a final exam is by far the most challenging thing I have ever done.
