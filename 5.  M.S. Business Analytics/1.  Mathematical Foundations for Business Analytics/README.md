# Repository for all coursework related to Mathematical Foundations for Business Analytics course.

1.  Discrete Mathematics and Probability Review:  introduction to discrete mathematics, set theory, graph theory and combinatorics, a review of basic probability theory, major continuous and discrete distributions, Bayes’ Theorem, conditional distributions, computing covariance, and correlation.

2.  Calculus Review: a refresher in the Calculus, focusing on three primary concepts – limits, the derivative and definite and indefinite integrals. Applications involving statistics will be used to supplant more traditional Calculus examples.  Emphasis will be on how to find and interpret derivatives and integrals by hand and via software.

3.  Matrix Algebra Review: Analytics deals with collections of data organized in multiple Compactly representing such data is best accomplished by the use of matrix notation, particularly when solutions to optimization (e.g., regression) or estimating (i.e, models) are involved. This portion of the course will cover the basics of vector and matrix algebra and operations necessary to understand multivariate statistical methods, including the notions of the matrix inverse, generalized inverse and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
