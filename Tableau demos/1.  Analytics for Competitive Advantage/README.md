# Some sample Tableau workbooks from MSBA 6250 - Analytics for Competitive Advantage.

# The PDF files contain the visualizations that were created to support the final write-ups for each of the projects below.  They showcase a variety of visualization techniques.

## 1.  WM Winters - Assessing the Effectiveness of Digital Channels

## 2.  Cloverleaf - Search Engine Marketing for Stores

## 3.  Sun Country Airlines* - Data-drive Customer Insights

* The Sun Country packaged workbook is too large to fit on the GitHub site but a local copy has been retained and can be sent if needed.
